# Vue 3 Deep Dive
This project replicates the code written by Evan You during the course **Vue 3 Deep Dive With Evan You** on [Vue Mastery](https://www.vuemastery.com).

The purpose of this project is to show some inner details about Vue, implementing a simplified vrsion of it, which takes into account the most important aspects:
- reactivity
- virtual DOM
- render functions

Since all the JS is directly written in HTML files, and needed libraries are imported from **unpkg** CDN, the code is immediately executable on any browser.
Most of the pages are blank. The interesting part is related to the JS code, which can be inspected by the DevTools console.
